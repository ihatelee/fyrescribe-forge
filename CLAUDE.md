# Fyrescribe — Claude Working Notes

## What "update documentation" means

When asked to "update documentation", "update CLAUDE.md", or "update the docs":
1. Update the **Current State** section to reflect what is now built and working.
2. Update the **Where We Left Off** section to reflect the current stopping point.
3. Append a new dated entry to **CHANGELOG.md** summarising what was done in the session.
4. Do NOT change the Tech Stack, Key Conventions, or Do Not Touch sections unless explicitly asked.

## Current State

Fyrescribe is a fantasy novel writing companion app. Users manage a project (a novel), write their manuscript in a chapter/scene editor, and will eventually use AI to extract world-building lore from their text.

### What is built and working

- **Auth** — Supabase email/password auth via `AuthPage`. `AuthContext` + `ProtectedRoute` gate all app routes.
- **Projects** — `ProjectsPage` lists all projects for the user. `ProjectContext` + localStorage persist the active project across navigation. Projects support inline title rename, duplicate, archive/unarchive, and delete (with typed confirmation).
- **Onboarding** — `OnboardingPage` offers "Start fresh" (opens `NewProjectModal`) or "Import a manuscript" (opens `ImportModal`). Import uploads the file to the `manuscripts` Supabase storage bucket and saves the storage path to `projects.manuscript_path`.
- **Manuscript editor** (`ManuscriptPage`) — Three-panel layout: sidebar (chapter/scene tree), editor (contentEditable), detail panel.
  - On first visit with no chapters, auto-creates Chapter 1 + Scene 1.
  - Chapter/scene names are editable inline (click to rename; Enter or blur saves).
  - Scene content auto-saves with a 1-second debounce.
  - `contentCache` Map ref preserves unsaved content across scene switches.
  - `data-initialized` guard on contentEditable prevents `innerHTML` reset on re-render.
  - `pendingAutoFocus` ref focuses the editor after auto-create.
- **Manuscript import pipeline (Part 1 — text only, no AI)**:
  - On first load with `manuscript_path` set but no chapters yet, the page downloads the file from storage, strips RTF if `.rtf`, then calls `parseManuscript`.
  - `parseManuscript` splits on double newlines, then re-splits each block at embedded heading lines (handles single-newline manuscripts). Book title (single-line pre-heading block) is skipped.
  - Chapters and scenes are inserted into Supabase sequentially.
- **Theme system** — `ThemeContext` + `ThemeSwitcher`. Six themes: Midnight, Fireside, Lavender Haze, Enchanted, Futureworld, Daylight. Preferences persisted to `user_preferences` Supabase table. Futureworld uses Silkscreen + Fira Code fonts; all other themes use Cinzel (display) + EB Garamond (prose) + system sans-serif (body). All theme styles — including fonts — flow exclusively through CSS variables (`--font-body`, `--font-display`, `--font-prose`, plus the full set of color tokens). `applyTheme` clears all managed variables before setting the new theme, guaranteeing no bleed-through.
- **Sparkle toggle** — `GlobalSparkle` + `StarfieldBackground` render an animated star/sparkle overlay, persisted alongside theme preference.
- **Entity system** — `EntityGalleryPage` + `EntityDetailPage` with 9 categories: characters, places, events, history, artifacts, creatures, magic, factions, doctrine.
  - `abilities` enum value renamed to `magic`; `history` added as a new enum value (`supabase/migrations/20260413000000_entity_category_updates.sql`).
  - POV Tracker removed from sidebar (route kept in App.tsx).
  - Each category has structured "At a Glance" fields (seeded from `CATEGORY_FIELDS` constant if empty). Field values that exactly match a project tag name render as clickable gold pills.
  - `sections` JSONB stores rich article sections; each category has a predefined section list.
  - Character entities have a "Magic & Abilities" section (rich text + linked magic entity pills) and a "Related Artifacts" linked section.
  - Creature entities have a "Characters of this Species" linked section (entity_links with `relationship="species"`).
  - Magic entities have sections: Description, Regional Origin, Known Users, Imbued Weapons & Artifacts.
  - History entities have sections: Overview, Causes, Key Figures, Consequences, Legacy.
  - Delete entity via three-dot actions menu → confirmation modal → deletes entity + entity_links (both directions) + entity_tags.
  - Smart tag clicking: 1 matching entity → navigate directly; >1 → filtered gallery at `/world?tag=tagId`. Applies on gallery cards and entity detail header tags.
  - Entity gallery supports tag filtering via `?tag=<id>` search param with "× Clear tag filter" pill.
- **Manuscript drag and drop** — scenes in the chapter/scene sidebar are `draggable`. Dragging a scene onto a different chapter's container moves it to that chapter in Supabase and updates the `order` field. Dropped-into chapters auto-expand. Visual highlight (gold glow + ring) on drag-over chapter.
- **Timeline** — `TimelinePage` reads from `timeline_events` Supabase table (real data, no placeholder). "Generate from Lore" button invokes the `generate-timeline` Supabase Edge Function which reads Event/History entities + scene excerpts, calls claude-sonnet-4-6 via Anthropic API, and inserts the returned `{label, date_label, date_sort, type}[]` events. Events can be deleted (hover reveals trash icon).
- **Storage buckets** — `entity-images` (entity gallery images), `manuscripts` (uploaded manuscript files). Both use RLS policies keyed on `storage.foldername(name)[1] = auth.uid()`.
- **Other pages** — `POVTrackerPage`, `LoreInboxPage` exist (scaffolded).

### What is NOT yet built

- Part 2 of manuscript import: AI analysis to extract lore suggestions into `lore_suggestions` table.
- Lore Inbox review flow (accept/reject/edit suggestions).
- POV tracker logic.
- Word count tracking (column exists on `scenes`, not yet wired up).
- Project archiving (column `archived_at` exists on `projects`, not yet used in UI).
- Timeline: manual "Add Event" button (button exists in UI but is not wired up).

## Where We Left Off

**Session: 2026-04-11 (session 3)**

Completed a 10-feature batch. Features 1–7 were implemented in the entity system (see Current State above). Features 8 and 10 were completed this session:

- **Feature 8 — Drag and drop scenes**: `ManuscriptPage.tsx` — scenes are now `draggable`; `handleDropSceneOnChapter` moves the scene to the target chapter in Supabase and reorders; visual gold-glow highlight on drag-over chapter.
- **Feature 10 — Timeline generate from lore**: `TimelinePage.tsx` replaced placeholder data with real `timeline_events` Supabase queries; "Generate from Lore" button invokes new `supabase/functions/generate-timeline/index.ts` edge function (Deno, calls Anthropic claude-sonnet-4-6, inserts results into `timeline_events`). Events are deletable via a hover-reveal trash icon.

Feature 9 (hide POV Tracker from sidebar) was part of the previous batch — already done.

**Next logical steps:**
- Deploy the `generate-timeline` edge function and set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret in Supabase project.
- Run DB migration `20260413000000_entity_category_updates.sql` against production to rename `abilities`→`magic` and add `history`.
- Test the import end-to-end with a real manuscript file.
- Begin Part 2: AI-powered lore extraction from manuscript scenes into `lore_suggestions`.

## Key Conventions

- **No default exports for utilities** — `manuscriptParser.ts` exports named functions.
- **contentEditable editors use `data-initialized`** — set `el.dataset.initialized = "true"` after the first `innerHTML` write; check it before writing to prevent resets on re-render.
- **Debounced saves** — use `useDebouncedCallback` (1 s) for scene content; call `supabase.from("scenes").update(...)` directly (no optimistic UI).
- **Sequential chapter insert** — when bulk-importing, insert each chapter one at a time to get its UUID before batch-inserting its scenes.
- **Storage paths** — `{user_id}/{project_id}/manuscript.{ext}` for manuscripts; `{user_id}/{entity_id}/{filename}` for entity images.
- **RLS everywhere** — every table has RLS enabled. Policies join back to `projects.user_id = auth.uid()`.
- **Heading detection regex** — `HEADING_RE = /^(chapter|part|prologue|epilogue|interlude)\b/i` in `manuscriptParser.ts`. Add new heading keywords here if needed.
- **Design tokens** — dark theme only. Key custom colours: `gold`, `gold-bright`, `fyrescribe-raised`, `fyrescribe-hover`, `text-dimmed`, `text-secondary`. Defined in `tailwind.config.ts`.
- **Font** — `font-display` class for headings (display/serif font); body uses system sans-serif stack.
- **Migrations** — live in `supabase/migrations/`. Run via Supabase CLI. Do not edit existing migrations; add new ones.

---

## Do Not Touch

- **RTF parser regexes** (`src/lib/manuscriptParser.ts` `stripRtf`) — do not modify without testing against a real RTF export first. The regex order matters; changing one rule can silently corrupt text.
- **Supabase RLS policies** — do not alter without careful review. Every table has RLS enabled; a wrong policy can expose data across users or lock the app out entirely.
- **`is_dirty` flag on `scenes`** — do not remove or bypass this flag. It is the trigger mechanism for the lore sync pipeline (Part 2), which queries dirty scenes to feed AI analysis.
- **`entity_category` enum values** — do not rename or remove enum values without a corresponding `ALTER TYPE … RENAME VALUE` / new-value migration. Existing DB rows reference these strings directly.
